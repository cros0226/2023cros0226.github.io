	<h2> My Favourite Movie: Disney's <i>Hercules</i> </h2>
	<!--Repeat this heading as default main heading for consistency across sections-->
	<!--W3 schools says to use i element only if others are not more appropriate: is there a better tag?-->

		<p> Disney's <i> Hercules </i> (1997) is an animated re-telling of one of the most famous heroes in Greek mythology. It follows the trials and tribulations of Hercules as he learns about his godly heritage and works to earn his place on Olympus. The catchy music and colourful animations are sure to delight the young and young-at-heart alike. </p>

		<!--Assignment instruction: Write about the movie in three lines.-->
		<!--Formatting might be nicer if each sentence was its own paragraph tag, revisit-->

	<h2> Funniest Lines from the Movie </h2>

		<h3> Most Iconic One-Liner: </h3>

			<p> <b>Meg:</b> I'm a damsel, I'm in distress, I can handle this. Have a nice day! &#128133;</p>

			<!-- Assignment instruction: Write something-->
			<!-- b tag usually last resort; used in this case to make text bold without other special emphasis-->

		<h3> Top Quote from IMBD: </h3>

			<p> <b>Hades:</b> I can't believe this guy! I throw everything I've got at him, and it doesn't even...</p>

			<p> <i> [Hades notices Pain is wearing Air-Hercs] </i> </p>

			<p> <b>Hades:</b> What...are...those? </p>

			<p> <b>Pain:</b> Um, I don't know. I-I thought they looked kinda dashing...</p>

			<p> <b>Hades:</b> <i> [slowly burns up] </i> I've got 24 hours to get rid of this...bozo, or the entire scheme I've been setting up for 18 years goes up in smoke, and YOU ARE WEARING HIS MERCHANDISE? </p>

			<p> <i> [Hades hears a noise, and sees Panic slurping some "Herculade"] </i> </p>

			<p> <b> Panic:</b> <i> [chuckles nervously] </i> Thirsty? </p>

			<p> <i> [Hades screams, and blows up a volcano] </i> </p>

			<!--This section mainly for practice: playing around with basic HTML font styles within p tags; how using multiple p tags breaks up lines (compare to movie description, above)-->
			<!--Also the final deadpan description of Hades blowing up a volcano will never not be funny-->

	<h2> Movie Ratings </h2>

			<p> <label for="file"> 00-18: </label>
				<progress id="file" value="7.3" max="10"> 73% </progress>
				(7.3) </p>
