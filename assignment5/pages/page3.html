        <h2> Who's Your Mama?</h2> 
        <p> There are several different accounts surrounding the circumstances of Hercules' birth. </p> 
        <p>Here's what a few of the major Greek poets and playwrights thought:</p>
          <ul> 
            <li><span class="emphasis1">Homer:</span> Zeus announced that his child would be born on a specific day and become ruler. Hera prevented Heracles' birth in favour of delivering Eurystheus early, thus fulfilling Zeus' oath.</li> <!--Add in span elements--> <!--Add in links to wikipedia pages-->
            <li><span class="emphasis1">Ovid: </span> <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcmene"> Alcmene </a> begged the goddess of childbirth for help in delivering Hercules, but instead she followed Hera's orders to prevent the birth. Galanthis tricked the goddess into allowing Hercules' birth, and was turned into a weasel for her troubles. </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis1"> Pausanius: </span> Hera sent witches to prevent Hercules' birth, but the daughter of Historis deceived them, allowing Alcmene to deliver the baby.</li>
            <li> <span class="emphasis1">Plautus:</span> Alcmene prays to Zeus for a pain-free childbirth, and Hercules is born without help after a bout of thunder and lightening.</li>
          </ul>
